<!-- Real rebellion is going to school wearing a clown suit -->
<p>
	When the subject of <strong>rebellion</strong> comes up with friends, I often quote this great phrase from “<a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/12/lonely-dissent.html">Lonely Dissent</a>”:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
	<strong>Real rebellion</strong> doesn't feel like going to school dressed in black.
	It feels like <strong>going to school wearing a clown suit</strong>.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
	<strong>For all you musicians and entrepreneurs who are used to having people tell you your plan, band, or company will never work</strong>, let this be a great reminder of what real rebellion feels like, and how sweet it is when everyone else is wrong.
