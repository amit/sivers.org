<!-- Be an extreme version of yourself -->
<!-- UPDATE: 2015-12-07 -->
<p>
	Define yourself by showing your outer boundaries.
</p><p>
	Show your weirdness.
	Bring out all your quirks.
</p><p>
	We all have our weird side, and our normal side.
	When youâ€™re feeling insecure or cautious, you tend to play it safe.
	But nobody wants that.
</p><p>
	Your public persona, the image you show to the world, should be an extreme version of yourself.
