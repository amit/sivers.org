<!-- Never use corporate-speak -->
<p>
	Don't try to sound pro or use industry catch phrases.
</p>
<p>
	Would you do that to a friend?
</p>
<p>
	Your fans are your friends.
	Speak to them like real people.
</p>
<p>
	Write every letter or email as if it were to a good friend.
	From you to your best friend Beth.
</p>
<p>
	Even if it's going out to 10,000 people.
