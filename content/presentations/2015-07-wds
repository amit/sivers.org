<!-- TITLE: Uncommon Sense - live @ WDS -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: Probably the best talk I’ve ever done. -->
<!-- MINUTES: 40 -->
<p>
I spent three months, working full-time, to write and practice a brand new talk for <a href="http://worlddominationsummit.com/">this big conference</a>.
But just a few days before the conference, I tested my new talk on friends.
They all said it sucked.
I agreed.
</p><p>
So I dusted off <a href="/uncommon">this talk from 2011</a>, which I thought I’d never do again, but was useful in this emergency, also because my <a href="/a">2011 book</a> was just re-released this year.
They’re old stories for me, but new and useful to most people, so I swallowed my pride and made the best of it.
It turned out really wonderful, loose, and fun.
I’m so glad I did it.
