<!-- TITLE: Uncommon Sense - live @ WDS -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: Probably the best talk I’ve ever done. -->
<!-- MINUTES: 40 -->
<p>
All of my business advice for entrepreneurs. A quick summary of almost everything I’ve learned.
</p><p>
This is basically the same as <a href="/uncommon">this talk</a>, but now in front of a laughing audience. Nice and loose.
