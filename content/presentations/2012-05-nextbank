<!-- TITLE: Next Bank Asia : Disrupting Banking -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: Addressing a room of bankers in Singapore about eliminating friction and serving tech entrepreneurs. -->
<!-- MINUTES: 16 -->
<p>
I was surprised when I was asked to speak at a banking conference, but they said they wanted it to be disruptive and untraditional, so I said yes. I've felt so much frustration with banks, that I thought this a fine time to vent.<br>
<br>
Main points:<br>
- The biggest bank in 20 years will be one that doesn't exist now.<br>
- Disruption starts by serving the low-end market<br>
- Internet entrepreneurs are the low-end market for banks<br>
- Banking is the bottleneck of entrepreneurship<br>
- Singapore is the place this disruption could/should happen<br>
- To protect your business, be paranoid. To advance, be fearless.
