<h1>What I’m doing now</h1>
<p>
I’m in New Zealand, staying quite focused, avoiding distractions.
<strong>I spend all my time on these things:</strong> <em>(in order of time spent)</em>
</p><ul><li>
being a full-time dad half the week
</li><li>
programming <a href="/projects">these projects</a> (<a href="https://github.com/sivers?tab=activity">see my progress</a>)
</li><li>
writing new articles, mostly around <a href="/2do">this theme</a>
</li><li>
answering emails that ask my advice
</li><li>
reading <a href="/book">books</a> to better think, work, or live
</li><li>
cleaning and translating <a href="https://github.com/sivers/sivers.org">sivers.org</a>
</li><li>
weightlifting, running, hiking
</li><li>
slowly <a href="/book/FluentForever">learning French</a>
</li><li>
and, how meta, managing <a href="/nowff">the /now movement</a>: the <a href="http://nownownow.com/">site</a>, <a href="https://github.com/50pop/nownownow.com">code</a>, lots of <a href="https://twitter.com/sivers">tweets</a>, and emails.
</li></ul>
</p><p>
Those are my priorities.
I don’t want to do anything else right now.
(<strong>No more speaking at conferences</strong> until further notice.)
</p><p>
People often ask me to do other things.  
I sincerely wish them the best, and often wish I could help more, but <strong>I say no to all requests</strong>, because I just need to focus on my work.
For years, I spent most of my time saying <a href="/hellyeah">yes</a> to people’s requests, but got nothing done myself.
</p><p>
I only do things for intrinsic reasons — not money.
</p><p>
<strong>My main act of public service is answering emails from strangers</strong>, so feel free to <a href="mailto:derek@sivers.org">email me</a>.
</p><p>
<strong>If my activities or priorities change, I’ll update this page.</strong>  Last update was November 2015.
