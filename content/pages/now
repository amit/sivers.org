<h1>What I’m doing now</h1>
<p>
I’m in New Zealand, staying quite focused, avoiding distractions.
<strong>I spend all my time on these things:</strong> <em>(in order of time spent)</em>
</p><ul><li>
being a full-time dad half the week
</li><li>
programming <a href="/projects">these projects</a> (<a href="https://github.com/sivers?tab=activity">see my progress</a>)
</li><li>
… specifically <a href="http://www.elm-lang.org/">Elm</a> (start <a href="https://pragmaticstudio.com/elm">here</a>) - and <a href="http://www.lua.org/about.html">Lua</a> for <a href="http://openresty.org/">OpenResty</a>
</li><li>
writing new articles, mostly around <a href="/2do">this theme</a>
</li><li>
answering emails that ask my advice
</li><li>
reading <a href="/book">books</a> to better think, work, or live
</li><li>
weightlifting 3× a week (as described <a href="/book/StartingStrength">here</a> and <a href="http://stronglifts.com/">here</a>)
</li><li>
listening to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Debussy">Debussy</a> almost exclusively
</li></ul>
</p><p>
Those are my priorities.
I don’t want to do anything else right now.
(<strong>No more speaking at conferences</strong> until further notice.)
</p><p>
People often ask me to do other things.  
I sincerely wish them the best, and often wish I could help more, but <strong>I say no to all requests</strong>, because I just need to focus on my work.
For years, I spent most of my time saying <a href="/hellyeah">yes</a> to people’s requests, but got nothing done myself.
</p><p>
I only do things for intrinsic reasons — not money.
</p><p>
<strong>My main act of public service is answering emails from strangers</strong>, so feel free to <a href="mailto:derek@sivers.org">email me</a>: derek@sivers.org
</p><p>
<strong>If my activities or priorities change, I’ll update this page.</strong>  Last update was February 2016.
