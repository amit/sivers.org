We all have occasional self-doubt.  The only cure better than recognition from our peers is recognition from our heroes. So please allow me this rare gloat, because I just had a very heartwarming 24 hours.
</p><p>
First, <a href="http://twitter.com/zen_habits/status/3721607898">my hero Leo Babauta linked</a> to my <a href="/hellyeah">“HELL YEAH!”</a> article.  Then two of my other heroes <a href="http://twitter.com/GuyKawasaki/status/3727655708">Guy Kawasaki</a> and <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/about.html">Kathy Sierra</a> linked to my <a href="/drama">Kurt Vonnegut explains drama</a> article.  (And then the <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2009/09/get-a-grip.html">the New Yorker</a>, too!)
</p><p>
(The highlight of the year was <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/seth_godin_on_the_tribes_we_lead.html">Seth Godin using me as an example in his TED talk</a> while I sat in the audience. And Chris Anderson quoting my “<a href="/reversible">Reversible business models</a>” article in his new book, “<a href="http://www.wired.com/techbiz/it/magazine/16-03/ff_free">Free!</a>”.)
</p><p>
So, like a musician names their musical influences, I think now's a good time for me to tell you about my heroes:
</p>

<h2>My Heroes:</h2>
<dl>

<dt><a href="http://sethgodin.com/sg/bio.asp">Seth Godin</a></dt>
<dd>
Seth is my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbi">rabbi</a>. My favorite thinker. A huge inspiration and mentor.  I often ask myself, “What would Seth say?” I usually don't even need to ask him, because I've ingested <a href="http://sethgodin.com/sg/books.asp">his books</a> so thoroughly. But I've called him in rare times of huge indecision since 2003, and his advice has directly influenced my biggest decisions. (<em>I'm being as succinct as possible, but even got a little teary-eyed thinking back about this</em>.) Thanks, Seth!
</dd>

<dt><a href="http://zenhabits.net/about/">Leo Babauta</a></dt>
<dd>
First <a href="http://zenhabits.net/2007/02/my-story/">read his story</a>, then <a href="/book/PowerOfLess">read his book</a>. Focus is required to have that level of effectiveness in whatever you do. In our crazy, distracted multitasking world, Leo's approach to life is a role model to me.
</dd>

<dt><a href="http://timferriss.com/">Tim Ferriss</a></dt>
<dd>
<a href="/tim-ferriss">Read my intro to our interview</a> for details, but this audacious punk and I are a lot alike. I admire his constant results-focused search for shortcuts and harmless cheating. (Why not gain an “unfair” advantage in education and self-development?) I admire how he throws himself completely into everything while treating it all as an experiment.
</dd>

<dt><a href="http://arielpublicity.com/">Ariel Hyatt</a></dt>
<dd>
One of my best friends because I so admire the way she thinks. Most recently she dove completely into her own re-education about modern marketing, learning from the masters in non-music realms, and is applying what she's learned back to the music world in an incredible way. She's my online marketing guru. Also, because she was raised by high-society New Yorkers and I was raised by a pack of wild kittens, she is my consultant on manners and norms. <img src="/images/icon_smile.gif" alt="smile" />
</dd>

<dt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Branson">Richard Branson</a></dt>
<dd>
Sir “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0753513188">Screw it, let's do it</a>”. AKA Sir “Ready. Fire. Aim.” I've read all of his biographies and autobiographies and so admire his approach of, “That sounds interesting. Let's make it a business.” I love his non-MBA intuitive approach to business, and never forgetting the real point is to make people happy.
</dd>

<dt><a href="http://gapingvoid.com/about/">Hugh MacLeod</a></dt>
<dd>
His book, “<a href="/book/IgnoreEverybody">Ignore Everybody</a>” is the absolute best I've read on thriving in the balance of creativity and business.   I love his perspective and refer to it often.
</dd>

<dt><a href="http://paulgraham.com/">Paul Graham</a></dt>
<dd>
His <a href="http://paulgraham.com/articles.html">essays</a> were a massive influence on me, so I loved it when he compiled them into <a href="http://paulgraham.com/hackpaint.html">a book</a>.  A fellow programmer and entrepreneur, his clear thinking always resonates with me. I aspire to write, think, and code as well as he does. His <a href="http://ycombinator.com/">VC firm</a> is a big inspiration.
</dd>

<dt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathy_Sierra">Kathy Sierra</a></dt>
<dd>
See her <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/">Creating Passionate Users</a> blog and click the “Past Favorites” on the left-hand side. Get one of the <a href="http://headfirstlabs.com/books.php">Head First books</a>. Whichever one appeals to you. They're all amazing. Such a great and effective way to learn anything. Her lessons in communication and teaching are in my head every time I write.
</dd>

<dt><a href="http://www.guykawasaki.com/about/">Guy Kawasaki</a></dt>
<dd>
One of my role models in constantly sharing everything he's learned. His new book “<a href="/book/RealityCheck">Reality Check</a>” is a great collection of his top blog articles. Not just a talker, he walks his talk <a href="http://www.garage.com/about/team.shtml">Garage</a>, <a href="http://alltop.com/about/">Alltop</a>, and more. 
</dd>

<dt><a href="http://beckwithpartners.com/keynote_and_seminar_speaker_harrybeckwith.aspx">Harry Beckwith</a></dt>
<dd>
Harry's book “<a href="http://beckwithpartners.com/sellingtheinvisible.aspx">Selling the Invisible</a>” is what got me to start writing.  If you haven't read it, please do.  Get into his mindset of considerate humanist marketing, so beautifully communicated. See <a href="/book/YouInc">my notes from his new book “You, Inc”</a> for a sample.  If Harry blogged, he'd be an online superstar.
