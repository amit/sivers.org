<strong>Reach people like you would want to be reached.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Would you rather have someone call you up in a dry business monotone, and start speaking a script like a telemarketer?
</p>
<p>
Or would you rather have someone be a cool person, a real person?
</p>
<p>
When you contact people, no matter how it's done  (phone, email, mail, face-to-face) - show a little spunk.  Stand apart from the crowd.
</p>
<p>
If it sounds like they have a moment and aren't in a major rush, entertain them a bit.  Ask about their day and expect a real answer.  Talk about something non-business for a minute or two.
</p>
<p>
Or - if they sound hectic, skip the “how are you”, skip the long introduction, ask your damn question and move out of the way.
</p>
<p>
This means <strong>you must know your exact question before you contact them</strong>, just in case that ultra-quick situation is needed.
</p>
<p>
Reach them like you would want to be reached.  Imagine what kind of phone call or email YOU would like to get.
</p>
<p>
If you're contacting fans, imagine what kind of flyer they would like to get in their mailbox.  Something dull and “just the facts” - or something a little twisted, creative, funny, entertaining and unique?  Something corporate, or something artistic?
</p>
<p>
This is a creative decision on your part. <strong>Every contact with the people around your music (fans and industry) is an extension of your art.</strong>  If you make depressing, morose, acoustic music, maybe you should send your fans a dark brown-and-black little understated flyer that's depressing just to look at.  Set the tone. Pull in those people who love that kind of thing.  Proudly alienate those that don't.
</p>
<p>
If you're an in-your-face, tattooed, country-metal-speedpunk band, have the guts to call a potential booking agent and scream, “Listen you crazy dirtbag! I'm going to explode! Ah! Aaaaaaah!!!”  If they like that introduction, you've found a good match.
</p>
<p>
Be different.  (Even if it's just in your remarkable efficiency.)
</p>
<p>
Everyone wants a little change in their day.
