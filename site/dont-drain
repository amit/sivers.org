“Whatever scares you, go do it.”  &lt;-- one of my favorite slogans
</p>
<p>
If something scares you in an excited way, (something that *gives* you energy) - that's a good sign.
</p>
<p>
BUT IF SOMETHING IS MAKING YOU MISERABLE AND DRAINING YOUR ENERGY, PLEASE STOP.
</p>
<p>
Life is telling you that is not the path for you.
</p>
<p>
QUICK EXAMPLE:  Biggest mistake I ever made in my life:
</p>
<p>
My band was doing well.  A well-meaning lawyer that I trusted told me that I should start a record label.  “Find and sign 3 other artists. Do for them what you did for your band.  Then sell the whole label for a million bucks!!”
</p>
<p>
I walked out of his office with slumped shoulders, miserable, saying, “yeah...  I guess he's right...”
</p>
<p>
With a long face, I plopped in a chair back home and thought, “Oh man... do I really have to do this?”  But because I trusted him, I spent 2 years of my life trying!
</p>
<p>
It wasn't what came natural to me, and so of course it was a failure, AND since I had spent so much time on it, the thing that I WAS good at  (making music)  was being ignored!!
</p>
<p>
I wish I would have paid attention to my lack of enthusiasm and stuck with the things that excited me.
</p>
<p>
Please don't make the same mistake.
</p>
<p>
<strong>If anything I'm talking about here makes you tired instead of wired, just don't do it!  Stick with what excites you.  That's where you'll find your success.</strong>
