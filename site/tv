You can't help but smile when you pass an old motel that still has the sign advertising “Color TV!”
</p><p>
In 1960, it was important to mention that you weren't talking about ordinary black and white TV.  No, this is the new special <em>color</em> TV!  Oooh!
</p><p>
But now that all TVs are color, it's funny to hear someone (even a sign) refer to it as “color” TV.  It really dates them.
</p><p>
Now I can't help but smile when I hear people talk about “online marketing.”
</p><p>
In 1995, it was important to mention that you weren't talking about ordinary print-paper marketing.  No, this is the new special <em>online</em> marketing!  Oooh!
</p><p>
But now that all marketing is online, it's funny to hear someone (especially a business person) refer to it as “online” marketing.  It really dates them.
