	All of these suggestions may sound exhausting to you.
</p>
<p>
	But keep that database at your fingertips.
	Get used to taking 1 minute after a conversation to take some notes about it.
	Give some of these ideas a try.
</p>
<p>
	You can probably tell, by reading this, that if you were to actually DO all of these things mentioned, you'd be much more successful than you are now.
	The gates of life would swing wide open.
</p>
<p>
	Hard to start, but easy to continue.
</p>
<p>
	Incredibly powerful when done every day.
	(Like a little river made the Grand Canyon.)
</p>
<p>
	Make these habits, and they won't seem hard.
