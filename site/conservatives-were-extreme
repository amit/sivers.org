<p>
	Think of the legendary performers in that conservative old-fashioned style.
	The ones even your grandmother could like.
</p>
<p>
	Frank Sinatra. Liberace. Liza Minelli. Barbara Streisand.
</p>
<p>
	Even the most conservative “legendary” performers were rather extreme characters.
</p>
<p>
	Don't be afraid to be as extreme as you can imagine.
	Being in the spotlight is the excuse.
	You can get away with anything, all in the name of entertainment.
