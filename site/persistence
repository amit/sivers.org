<p>
	As teenagers, we painfully learned that if you call someone and they don't call you back, they're just not into you.
	If you keep calling, you must be a total loser.
</p>
<p>
	But in the business world, <strong>it's the opposite: persistence is polite, and if you don't keep calling, you must be a loser</strong>.
</p>
<p>
	Imagine this:
</p>
<ul><li>
	You call me, and get my voicemail.
	You leave a message.
</li><li>
	You don't know that I hardly ever listen to voicemail.
</li><li>
	A few days later you call again, but I'm out, so you leave a message with a real person in my office.
</li><li>
	I see a message on my desk that you called, and I mean to call you, but I get distracted.
</li><li>
	My desk fills up with other stuff, and buries the little message, so I forget.
</li><li>
	You email me to let me know you've been trying to reach me, but your email arrives just as I'm leaving for a conference for 5 days.
</li><li>
	When I return from the conference, I've got 1000 emails in my IN box.
</li><li>
	You call again, talk to someone in my office, and tell them to tell me it's important, that you've left messages with no reply.
</li><li>
	They come knock on my office door to tell me you're on the phone.
</li><li>
	I finally pick up the phone and say, “Hi!  Sorry I was hard to reach.”
</li></ul>
<p><strong>
	At this point, I am sincerely glad that you had the manners to keep trying, because I really did want to talk to you.
</strong></p>
<p>
	Imagine this, instead:
</p>
<ul><li>
	You call me, and get my voicemail.
	You leave a message.
</li><li>
	I get busy with other things, and forget to call you back.
</li><li>
	You silently rage for years, thinking I'm an asshole, thinking I hate you, so you hate me, too.
</li></ul>
<p><strong>
	Calling once, and never again like that, is rude and inconsiderate.
</strong></p>
<p>
	In this business, you have to <strong>prove that something is important to you</strong> by being persistent.
	If you mail someone a package, and don't follow-up until you reach them, it means you didn't care.
</p>
<p><strong>
	Persistence is polite and considerate, because it shows that you understand how busy people can get.
	It also shows how much you care.
