An amazing shift has happened in the last 10 years, as an artist.
</p><p>
<strong>You now have a better chance of being successful by being remarkably unusual</strong>, than by being normal and mainstream.
</p><p>
Songwriters constantly search for that universal theme, aiming to write the next “Yesterday” that will resonate with millions of people for decades to come.
</p><p>
But what good is the next “Yesterday” if nobody hears it because your music is too normal?
</p><p>
(See my article called “<a href="http://sivers.org/well-rounded">Well-Rounded Doesn't Cut</a>”.)
</p><p>
You already know we're moving to a niche-driven culture, probably permanently.  In 1948, Milton Berle's TV show had 80% of all viewers, because it was one of only three choices!  When the Beatles played on Ed Sullivan, they had 60% of all viewers.  The biggest American Idol episode gets 30% now.  There won't be another Michael Jackson Thriller or Fleetwood Mac Rumours.
</p><p>
With unlimited options online, music fans don't wait for mainstream media to tell them what to do - they explore, click, follow links, and can immediately listen to absolutely anything they've heard people talk about.  Because of this, tastes are more spread-out than ever.
</p><p>
Your goal should be to <strong>attract and excite the people who have headed to the edges</strong>.  They're the ones who are looking for something new, and more likely to rave about it if you impress them.
</p><p>
<strong>I think of this like an archery range metaphor:</strong>
</p><p>
In the old music business (before 1997) it felt like hit-single-or-nothing.  The only way you could be successful was to hit a tiny 1-inch target on the other side of a field.  If you missed by an inch, you get nothing.

</p><p>
Now it's like the target is huge, and you can aim for the edges, and hit something pretty easily - BUT - there's a catch : someone cut out the middle.
<br /><img src="/images/archer-easy.jpg" alt="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davepearson/537677681/" />
</p><p>
If you're still aiming for the middle of the target, there's nothing there.  They're all out exploring niches.
</p><p>
Aim for the edges.
