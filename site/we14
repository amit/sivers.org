If you know you’ll never go to Asia, you can skip this.
</p><p>
If you’re looking for a travel guide, you can skip this.
</p><p>
But if you might do business in Asia, have thought about moving to Asia, or just want to understand the cultures of Asia, you will love this.
</p><p>
<strong>16 books about moving to and doing business in 16 countries in Asia:</strong> 
<a href="http://woodegg.com/kh">Cambodia</a>,
<a href="http://woodegg.com/cn">China</a>,
<a href="http://woodegg.com/hk">Hong Kong</a>,
<a href="http://woodegg.com/in">India</a>,
<a href="http://woodegg.com/id">Indonesia</a>,
<a href="http://woodegg.com/jp">Japan</a>,
<a href="http://woodegg.com/kr">Korea</a>,
<a href="http://woodegg.com/my">Malaysia</a>,
<a href="http://woodegg.com/mn">Mongolia</a>,
<a href="http://woodegg.com/mm">Myanmar</a>,
<a href="http://woodegg.com/ph">Philippines</a>,

</p><p>
They’re all <strong>ebooks for under $10 each, sold at LeanPub, Amazon, and Apple iBooks.</strong>
</p><p>
Plus this year there’s <a href="http://woodegg.com/aa">a 17th book, combining all 16 books into one massive 4448-page ebook</a>, for easy comparison between different countries.
</p><p>
Please <strong>go to <a href="http://woodegg.com/">woodegg.com</a> to check them out now.</strong>
</p><p>
These 2014 editions were <strong>all written in the last three months, based on research from the last six months.</strong>  They’re the most current and thorough guides of their kind.
</p><p>
The 2013 editions were OK, but I never promoted them because I wanted them to be deeper, more thorough, and more insightful.  But these 2014 editions were created by some amazing researchers and writers, so I can now proudly say these books are really very good.  (I’ll save the superlatives for future editions, since we’ll be re-writing them every year - an annual improvement process.)
</p><p>
I’ll have more to say about them in the coming weeks.
</p><p>
But for now, I just want to say <a href="http://woodegg.com/">they’re here</a>.  Two years of effort by over 140 people.  I’m so thrilled, and honestly a little in awe of what we’ve created.
</p><p>
I hope you <a href="http://woodegg.com/">buy one</a>, and hope you like it. <strong>Click any book cover, below, to jump to the page for it.</strong>
