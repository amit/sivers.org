<strong>I started CD Baby 10 years ago this week - in March 1998</strong>.
<p>
You probably know that I'm just a musician-geek, not a business-man.  Never meant to start a company.  I was just selling my own CD, then helped some friends do it, then it accidently turned into CD Baby.  (Ooops!)
</p><p>
Now <a href="http://cdbaby.com/about">CD Baby has paid over $70 million dollars</a>(!!) directly to musicians.  And despite the moaning you hear from the major labels, independent artists are selling better than ever.  Even physical CD sales are up 30% over last year!
</p><p>
<strong>ANNOUNCEMENT</strong>:
</p><p>
Friends will tell you that for the past 10 years I've spent most waking hours, 7 days a week, doing nothing but CD Baby.  Last year I just slept on the couch at the office for 6 months, usually working from 7am to midnight.
</p><p>
So today seems like a good day to tell you that <strong>I don't work at CD Baby anymore, and haven't in months</strong>.
</p><p>
<strong>I'm still the owner</strong>, but haven't been to the office since May.  The crew there is running things better than I ever could.  They know more than I do, and do a better job.
</p><p>
I've made that transition from self-employed to business-owner.  (You know you're a true business-owner when you can leave your business for a year, and come back to find it's doing much better than when you left.)
</p><p>
<strong>WHY AM I TELLING YOU THIS</strong>?
</p><p>
Because <strong>the reason I freed-up my time is to find more ways to help you</strong>.
</p><p>
<strong>Helping you develop, create, promote, and sell your music makes me happier than anything</strong>.  It's still why I bounce out of bed in the morning.
</p><p>
I love it even more than making my own music.  (Weird, huh?)   By helping you get your music out to the world, and helping you make a living doing it, I feel that in a way I'm making more music than ever.
</p><p>
There are many ways I can help you, but I'll email you about those next week.
</p><p>
Today was just a CD Baby birthday announcement.  Still, I wanted to let you know there are exciting things to come.
