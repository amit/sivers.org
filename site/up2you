<p>
Nobody's going to help you. It's all up to you.
</p><p>
Does hearing that discourage you or motivate you?
</p><p>
For example: are you hoping that a great world-class booking agent will find you and sign you?
</p><p>
I believe no great agents will want to take you on unless you're already earning $5000 a month gigging, so that their 10% cut (only $500) would be worth their time.
</p><p>
Or are you hoping to find a big investor for your music? Someone to invest $500k into your band for radio promotion, touring, recording, videos, publicity, payola, etc.
</p><p>
I believe there are no investors that would invest in a musician now. Even solid profitable businesses with customers and employees can't find investors these days, so just assume you will not.
</p><p>
So: No agent. No investor. No one's going to help you until you're already successful. So how do you get successful with no help from anyone?
</p><p>
How can you make $5000/month from gigging, so that an agent will be interested enough to take it to the next level?  Only you know.
</p><p>
How can you call so much attention to your music online, that a company will gamble on you, and finance the expensive offline campaign?
</p><p>
Those are the healthy questions to ask.
</p></blockquote><p>
Unfortunately that's not the answer he wanted.
</p><p>
To him, my answer was really discouraging.
</p><p>
To me, (if I was receiving that answer from someone else), it would be really encouraging.
</p><p>
I like being reminded that nobody's going to help me - that it's all up to me.  It puts my focus back on the things I can control - not waiting for outside circumstances.
</p><p>
But it got me wondering:  is that just me?
</p><p>
When you think that nobody's going to help you, does that encourage you or discourage you?
</p><p>
I'm really interested to hear everyone's honest answer.  Please leave a reply in the comments here.  Thanks!
