I get emails from many people who want to make a big change in their career.
</p><p>
Each one wants to quit their current career, and boldly leap into their new venture or preferred lifestyle.
</p><p>
When they ask my advice, they think I'm going to say, “Yes! Quit! Go for it!”
</p><p>
But instead, they're surprised at my suggestion:
</p><p>
Remember how Tarzan swings through the jungle?
He doesn't let go of the previous vine until the next vine is supporting his weight.
</p><p>
<img src="/images/tarzan-600x450.gif" width="600" height="450" alt="Tarzan swinging on vines">
</p><p>
So my advice is: Change careers like Tarzan.
</p><p>
<strong>Don't let go of the old one until the new one is supporting you.</strong>
</p><p>
And <strong>make sure you don't lose momentum</strong>.
</p><hr><p>
P.S.  I highly recommend reading the book “<a href="http://sivers.org/book/SoGood">So Good They Can't Ignore You</a>” for more thoughts on this.
</p><p>
P.P.S.  Full credit for the “momentum” metaphor goes to <a href="http://philippantar.com/">Philipp Antar</a>, from the comments, below.
