Please see this new page I created for you:

Last year I started keeping track of all the books I read.  Underlining my favorite bits, and typing out notes for later.  Then I refer back to my notes often, so keep what I've learned fresh in my mind.
</p><p>
So, if you're needing some new ideas or inspiration, check out my book list at <a href="http://sivers.org/book">http://sivers.org/book</a>
</p><p>
Each one has the ISBN number and Amazon link, so you can go read more about it, or reserve it at your local library.
</p><p>
Now that I've finally got this list up, I'm going to start posting some specific highlights of lessons-learned from these books to my blog.
</p><p>
But for now, I just wanted you to be able to explore the list for yourself:  <a href="http://sivers.org/book">http://sivers.org/book</a>

Feel free to ask any questions about them or just let me know if you've read the same ones, too!
