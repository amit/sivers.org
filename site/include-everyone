	If you're putting your fans to work, let them know they're on the “inside family” now. 
	That if you hit it big, THEY hit it big.
</p>
<p>
	No need to make specific promises.  It's a feeling more than a contract.
</p>
<p>
	Same with your casual fans and email list.
	Make them part of an exclusive club.
	Bring them inside.
</p>
<p>
	Everybody wants to be able to say they hung out with ____(your name here)_____ when she was just playing little clubs in her hometown, and now look at her!
