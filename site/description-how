	How do you come up with one good phrase to describe your music?  Here are some ideas:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
	Email everyone you know (especially your fans), saying you're trying to come up with a single phrase to describe your music, and ask their help.
	Maybe make it a contest.
</li>
<li>
	Notice what's most unique about you.
	Do your songs have a recurring theme?
	Unusual instrumentation?
</li>
<li>
	Find a few 14-year-old kids, and treat them to pizza if they'll sit and listen to a few songs, and describe it for you while waiting for the pizza to arrive.
</li>
<li>
	Read a music magazine that's describing other people's music you've never heard before.
	Notice which phrases make you curious to hear more.
</li>
<li>
	Offer to pay a music writer to help you.
	This is what they do for a living.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
	When you've got one you like, start trying it out on people.
	Watch their face.
	See if it lights up.
	See if they get curious.
</p>
<p>
	When you've got a great one, you'll know it.
	Use it for years and years.
