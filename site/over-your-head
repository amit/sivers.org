	Stay in over your head.
</p><p>
	Whatever you're doing in your life right now, if it's become a routine, it's time to move on to something new and scary.
</p><p>
	Abraham Maslow wrote, “Life is an ongoing process of choosing between safety (out of fear and need for defense) and risk (for the sake of progress and growth): <strong>Make the growth choice a dozen times a day</strong>.”
</p><p>
	Whatever scares you, go do it.
