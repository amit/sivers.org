Last night I spent far too much time tinkering with setting up both the <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a> and <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a> operating systems to dual-boot on my laptop.
</p><p>
This morning I found out one of my best friends died yesterday.  He was in great health, was out on a bike ride on a quiet street, and a car swerved into the bike lane, <a href="http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2013/12/08/bicyclist-struck-and-killed-by-sheriffs-radio-car-in-calabasas/">killing him instantly</a>.
</p><p>
I let him share my online music account.  He had just downloaded the entire Bruce Springsteen and Neil Young catalog yesterday before he left on his ride.
</p><p>
I’ve been crying off and on all morning, thinking about the things we do with our time.  What’s worthy and what’s a waste.
</p><p>
It really is limited.  We can’t pretend it’s not.  Time spent doing one thing is time spent not doing something else.
</p><p>
It’s so easy to waste time doing that stuff that’s of no importance, no challenge, no benefit to anyone, not even yourself.
</p><p>
It’s so hard to fight the <a href="/book/WarOfArt">resistance</a> to do the more difficult but more important thing.  Finishing that book.  Writing that song.  Launching that project.
</p><p>
I spent this morning thinking about what doesn’t matter (like dual-booting FreeBSD and OpenBSD) and what does.  For me, <strong>writing</strong> is about the most worthy thing I can do with my time.  I love how the distributed word is eternal - that every day I get emails from strangers thanking me for things I wrote years ago that helped them today.  I love how those things will continue to help people long after I’m gone.
</p><p>
So this lesson is dedicated to you, Milt.  I’m going to start writing again.
