<p>
The word “inspiration” usually means something that mentally stimulates you.
</p><p>
But “inspiration” also means to <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/inspiration">breathe in</a>.
</p><p>
The meanings poetically combine when you think of yourself breathing in thoughts, filling your body with ideas.
</p><p>
But don’t forget to breathe out.
</p><br><p>
Some people watch hundreds of <a href="http://www.ted.com/speakers/derek_sivers.html">TED talks</a>, looking for inspiration.
</p><p>
Tech entrepreneurs visit <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> every few hours, looking for new inspiration.
</p><p>
Musicians, writers, artists, and everyone else, all scouring the world for inspiration.
</p><p>
Breathing in, and in, and in, and in.
</p><p>
Yet most of them aren’t feeling inspired enough.  They’re looking for more, thinking something else out there will truly inspire them.
</p><p>
Want to know why?
</p><p>
<strong>Because nothing is truly inspiring unless you apply it to your work.</strong>  <em>(“work” meaning your life’s output, whether creative, business, or personal.)</em>
</p><p>
In other words, <strong>your work, itself, is the inspiration.</strong>
</p><p>
You may hear something or see something that gives you a new idea.But it’s only when you stop and think of your work through this new perspective, that you actually <strong>jump up and go turn the idea into reality.</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>That’s the real inspiration that everyone is looking for!</strong>
</p><p>
The inspiration is not the receiving of information.  The inspiration is <strong>applying</strong> what you’ve received.
</p><p>
People think that if they keep reading articles, browsing books, listening to talks, or meeting people, that they’re going to suddenly get inspired.
</p><p>
But <strong>constantly seeking inspiration is anti-inspiring.</strong>
</p><p>
You have to pause the input, and focus on your output.
</p><p>
For every bit of inspiration, use it and amplify it by applying it to your work.
</p><p>
Then you’ll finally feel the inspiration you’ve been looking for.
</p><p>
Breathe in. Breathe out. Breathe in. Breathe out.
