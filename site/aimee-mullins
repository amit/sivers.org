One of the best talks I saw at <a href="http://conferences.ted.com/TED2009/">TED</a> was by <a href="http://www.aimeemullins.com/about.php">Aimee Mullins</a>.
</p><p>
She was wearing a skirt, but it took a couple minutes before I realized that her legs were artificial. (Both of her legs were amputated below the knee when she was one year old.)
</p><p>
Aimee told two stories:
</p><p>
Recently she was speaking at a grade school, and before she walked in, she overheard the teacher tell the kids, “Make sure you don't look at her legs! It's rude.” 
</p><p>
So she started her talk by having all the kids gather around to feel her legs, and ask anything.
</p><p>
Later she asked the class, “If I wanted to jump over a house, what kind of legs would I need?” The kids brainstormed springs and kangaroos, before one kid asked, “Why would you only jump over a house? Why not a skyscraper?”
</p><p>
She loved that their perception of her was as a superwoman, not a disabled woman.
</p><p>
Later, she was out to dinner with friends wearing a new pair of legs.
</p><p>
Her friend said, “Why are you so tall today?”
</p><p>
She said, “New legs. I'm six-foot-one in these.”
</p><p>
Her friend, with no irony, said, “But... that's not fair!”
</p><p>
Beautiful.  Even among friends, she's seen as having an unfair advantage.
