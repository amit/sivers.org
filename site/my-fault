<p>
I cut two chapters out of <a href="/a">my book</a> because they were too nasty.
</p><p>
They vented all the awful details about how my terrible employees staged a mutiny to try to get rid of me, and corrupted the culture of the company into a festering pool of entitlement, focused only on their benefits instead of our clients.
</p><p>
Afterwards, I spent a few years still mad at those evil brats for what they did.  So, like anyone feeling victimized and wronged, I needed to vent - to tell my side of the story.  Or so I thought.
</p><p>
So do you want to know <strong>the real reason I cut those chapters?</strong>
</p><p>
I realized it was all my fault.
</p>
<ul>
<li><em>I</em> let the culture of the company get corrupted.</li>
<li><em>I</em> ignored problems instead of nipping them in the bud.</li>
<li><em>I</em> was aloof and away instead of managing or training managers.</li>
<li><em>I</em> confused everyone by sharing my daily thoughts before they had cemented into decisions.</li>
<li><em>I</em> announced decisions, then assumed they were being done, without following-up to ensure.</li>
<li><em>I</em> whimsically delegated to the wrong people, avoiding the mental work of choosing wisely.</li>
<li>(I could list another 20 of these, but you get the idea.)</li>
</ul>
<p>
It felt so SO good to realize it was my fault!
</p><p>
<strong>This is way better than forgiving.</strong>  When you forgive, you’re still playing the victim, and they’re still wrong, but you’re charitably pardoning their horrible deeds.
</p><p>
But to decide it’s your fault feels amazing!  Now you weren’t wronged.  <strong>They were just playing their part in the situation you created.</strong>  They’re just delivering the punch-line to the joke you set up.
</p><p>
What power!  Now you’re like a new super-hero, just discovering your strength.  Now you’re the powerful person that made things happen, made a mistake, and can learn from it.  Now you’re in control and there’s nothing to <a href="/complainers">complain</a> about.
</p><p>
This philosophy feels so good that <strong>I’ve playfully decided to apply this “EVERYTHING IS MY FAULT” rule to the rest of my life.</strong>
</p><p>
It's one of those base rules like “people mean well” that's more fun to believe, and have a few exceptions, than to not believe at all.
</p>
<ul>
<li>The guy that stole $9000 from me? <strong>My fault.</strong>  I should have verified his claims.</li>
<li>The love of my life that dumped me out of the blue (by email!) after 6 years? <strong>My fault.</strong>  I let our relationship plateau.</li>
<li>Someone was rude to me today? <strong>My fault.</strong>  I could have lightened their mood beforehand.</li>
<li>Don’t like my government? <strong>My fault.</strong>  I could get involved and change the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>See what power it is?</strong>
</p><p>
Yes, the word “responsibility” is more accurate, but it's such a serious 6-syllable word, whereas “everything’s my fault” is a fun rule-of-thumb, and gets me singing Nirvana’s “<a href="http://www.metrolyrics.com/all-apologies-lyrics-nirvana.html">All Apologies</a>”.
</p><p> 
Try it on.  Stand up, open the window, look out at the world and shout, “<strong>Everything is my fault!</strong>”
</p><p>
Think of every bad thing that happened to you, and say it again.
</p><p>
Cool, huh?
</p><p>
That power looks good on you.
