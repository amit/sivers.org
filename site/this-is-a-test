Growing up in America in the 1970's, the TV or radio would often turn into a long warning BEEEEEP.  At the end, an announcer would say, “This is a test. This is only a test.”
</p><p>
Remember that phrase when pursuing your career.
</p><p>
It often feels like everything is so serious - that if you make one mistake, it will all end in disaster.  But really everything you do is just a test: an experiment to “see what happens”.
</p><p>
My favorite times in life have often started with a “see what happens” spirit.
</p><p>
Let's see what happens if I run my vocals through my guitar pedals.
</p><p>
See what happens if I invite that famous producer out to lunch.
</p><p>
See what happens if I call that radio station to ask their advice.
</p><p>
<strong>There is no failure.  There can't be, if your only mission was to “see what happens”</strong>.
</p><p>
This is a test. This is only a test. There is no downside. Try everything.
</p>
