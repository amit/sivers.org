At <a href="/conferences-2009">music-biz conferences</a>, there are always panels of experts, talking about the current state of the music business, from their point of view.
</p><p>
They're usually men over 40 who have been in the music business for 20 years, and they say things like:
</p><ul>
<li>“the music business isn't what it used to be”</li>
<li>“it doesn't have any vision anymore”</li>
<li>“nobody knows what's going on anymore”</li>
<li>“it's too big and bloated and corrupt now”</li>
</ul>
<p>
My friend <a href="http://www.financial-gurus.com/gurus/6570/Clem-Chambers/">Clem Chambers</a> said, “Have you noticed <strong>they're just projecting their own decaying health into things</strong>?”
</p><ul>
<li>they aren't what they used to be</li>
<li>their vision is fading</li>
<li>they don't know what's going on anymore</li>
<li>they're big and bloated and corrupt</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>So of course that's how they're going to see the world!</strong>
</p><p>
Wouldn't it be interesting to get a panel of under-20 musicians and entrepreneurs to talk about how the music business looks to them?
