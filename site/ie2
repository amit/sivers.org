<p>I loved <a href="http://www.gapingvoid.com/">Hugh MacLeod</a>'s “<a href="/book/IgnoreEverybody">Ignore Everybody</a>” book, but I wanted to see what my musician friends thought of it.  <a href="http://www.alexkrupp.com/">Alex Krupp</a> had some extra copies from <a href="http://www.swagapalooza.com/">Swagapalooza</a>, which I promised to put to good use. (Thanks Alex!)</p>

<p>So I mailed a copy of the book to 15 different musicians so they could post their thoughts.  Here they are, below.  Click “LINK” to read their full post.</p>

<p>Huge thanks to <a href="http://emarmusic.com/">Melissa Rebronja</a> for making this surprisingly-big project happen!</p>

<p>“a concise and powerful presentation of deep concepts embedded in the struggle for the development of human potential in the creative world. It also links together creativity and worldly success and makes them seem possibly attainable and not entirely contradictory.”

<p>“I've heard it said, ‘the best way to be original is to be yourself’. This is a saying that stuck with me, and throughout my life and especially as a creative person, I have done my best to live this way.  Still, every so often I, like most of us, am guilty of losing sight of this simple truth.  Hugh drives this point home time and time again in his book, and I appreciate him doing so.”

<h4><a href="http://raveonstudio.com/">Jenn Ashton, of Rave On Studio:</a></h4>
<p>“To start off, Hugh says: ‘When you have a good or great idea, the people closest to you will often react negatively’. This is true in any arena, people won’t want you to change. Change is uncomfortable, and in the music industry, I guess there is a real possibility that you and your life may change if you ever let ‘fame’ get into your head.”

<p>“I read Ignore Everybody in one sitting the day I received it. For a creative person, its like having your past re-read to you by someone without the emotional involvement, who has enough sense of the modern ethos and of the symptoms of the failing artistic endeavor of the common creative person.”
