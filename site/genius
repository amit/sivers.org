Last week I was at the <a href="https://conferences.ted.com/TED2009/">TED Conference</a> and saw this talk by <a href="http://www.elizabethgilbert.com/">Elizabeth Gilbert</a> that really speaks to every musician and writer I know.

<p>
I promise the 19 minutes will be very well-spent. Then I'm curious to hear your thoughts, below.

<ul>
<li>Do you feel songs come “through” you? </li>
<li>Do you wait for inspiration?</li>
<li>Or do you just work and work no matter what?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Do you feel you've already achieved your “greatest hit”?</li>
<li>Or is your greatest work yet-to-come?</li>
</ul>
<p>
I think other musicians would be curious to hear your thoughts on this too, since it's often a very lonely pursuit, so feel free to leave a comment at the bottom of this page.
