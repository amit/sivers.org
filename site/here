Looking around the room.
</p><p>
“Why am I here?”
</p><p>
It’s a useful question to ask often.
</p><p>
Either it will <strong>re-focus</strong> your reasons for being where you are, or it will make you realize your reasons have <strong>expired</strong> and you should be somewhere else.
</p><p>
In a little apartment in Singapore, I ask it again.
</p><p>
“Why am I here?”
</p><p>
Because of the brilliant and fascinating people here.
</p><p>
<em>(But I’m refusing all requests to meet, to stay focused on my work.  For the past 3 years I was very social, but now I’m not.)</em>
</p><p>
Because I love learning about Asia, and Singapore is a great central home base for that.
</p><p>
<em>(But I’m not exploring Asia right now.  For the past 3 years I was, but now I’m inwardly-focused on my writing and programming.)</em>
</p><p>
Because I love and admire it, and it feels like home.
</p><p>
<em>(But I’ve loved everywhere I’ve lived, from California to New York to London to Portland.  They’ve all felt like home.  Future places will feel like home, too.)</em>
</p><p>
Because I’m here right now.
</p><p>
<em>(But there are airplanes.  You can sit in them.)</em>
</p><p>
<strong>Most of us are where we are because of decisions we made years ago.  But are those reasons still current for what we need now?  Ask again.</strong>
</p><p>
“Why am I here?”
</p><p>
Damn.  I ran out of reasons.  I should be somewhere else.
</p><p>
I want silence, solitude, and wide open spaces.
</p><p>
I want to work all day while listening to nothing but birds and wind in the trees.
</p><p>
I want an intentional lack of distractions, far far away, to cure my tendency to say yes to intellectually stimulating events.
</p><p>
So the answer was clear.
</p><p>
I moved to New Zealand’s South Island.
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.newzealand.com/int/nelson/">Here</a> I am.
</p><p>
“Why am I here?”
</p><p>
To work.  To focus.  To write.  To code.  To launch.
</p><p>
Yes. Good answer.
