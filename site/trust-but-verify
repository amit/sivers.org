Trust but verify.
</p><p>
Three words I wish I would have heard years ago.
</p><p>
A lesson in delegating that would have saved me so much frustration.
</p><p>
Running my first business with employees, it was a real effort to learn how to delegate.
</p><p>
Everyone knows that feeling: “They’re not doing it as good as me. Here - I’ll do it myself.”
</p><p>
I was trapped in that for years, so when it was obvious I had to delegate or die, I tried really hard to let go.
</p><p>
I tried not to micro-manage.  To trust that they’re smart and will get the work done well.
</p><p>
But a few devastating times, I found out that I had tried <em>too</em> hard not to micro-manage.  I hadn’t managed at all.  <strong>I had said something once, thought it was understood and agreed, and assumed the best.</strong>
</p><p>
But things had gone horribly wrong.  Months of orders had not been processed.  Money had disappeared from the bank.  Projects I thought were underway had never been started.
</p><p>
In all of the cases, <strong>a simple one-minute verification along the way would have prevented everything.</strong>
</p><p>
I could get mad at them, but really it was my fault for not building that verification step into the plan.  
</p><p>
Not micro-managing, it can be as simple as:
<ul>
<li>asking them to email you when done with each step</li>
<li>or a “dashboard” style monitor showing the progress of projects</li>
<li>or a simple note-to-self system to check in with someone a few days after you’ve assigned them something, to make sure it’s going OK</li>
<li>or <em>anything!</em> - but don't ignore it.</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
So here I am sharing one of my hardest delegation lessons learned, in hindsight.
</p><p>
Trust but verify.
