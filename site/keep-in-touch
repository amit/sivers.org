<strong>Sometimes the difference between success and failure is just a matter of keeping in touch!</strong>
</p>
<p>
There are some AMAZING musicians who have sent a CD to CD Baby, and when I heard it, I flipped.  In a few cases, I've stopped what I was doing at that moment, picked up the phone and called them wherever they were to tell them I thought they were a total genius.  (Believe me - this is rare.  Maybe 1 in 500 CDs that I hear.)
</p>
<p>
Often I get an answering machine, and guess what...  they don't call back!!  What masochistic anti-social success-sabotaging kind of thing is that to do?
</p>
<p>
Then 2 weeks later I've forgotten about their CD as new ones came in.
</p>
<p>
The lesson:  If they would have just called back, and kept in touch, they may have a fan like no other at the head of one of the largest distributors of independent music on the web.  A fan that would go out on a limb to help their career in ways others just dream of.  But they never kept in touch and now I can't remember their names.
</p>
<p>
Some others whose CDs didn't really catch my attention the first time around, just keep in touch so well that I often find myself helping them more as a friend than a fan.
</p>
<p>
Keep in touch, keep in touch, keep in touch!
</p>
<p>
People forget you very fast.
