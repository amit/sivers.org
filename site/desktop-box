	The self-promoting musician of the past needed to always have a presskit (with CD and photo) nearby and ready to send.
</p><p>
	As a modern self-promoting musician, you need to keep a “PROMO BOX” folder on the desktop of your computer.
</p><p>
	It will take you just one hour to put together, and you'll be able to use it again and again and again:
</p><p>
	Make a folder on your desktop called “promo box” and put these things inside for quick easy access:
</p>
<ul><li>
	<strong>All of your best songs, in hi-fi MP3.</strong>
	Give each one a nice long name, without spaces, so that if anyone runs across it on the web they know who it is.
	(YourName-TheSongTitle.mp3)
</li><li>
	<strong>An entertaining bio written four times, in four different lengths:</strong>
<ol><li>
	Long version (over 3 paragraphs, 1-2 pages, exhaustive and rarely used)
</li><li>
	Medium long version (2-4 entertaining and important paragraphs - the top end of what people will sit and read online)
</li><li>
	Short version (1 great paragraph)
</li><li>
	One-liner  (1 great sentence)
</ol>
</li><li>
	<strong>Quotes from reviews:</strong>
<ol><li>
	one big text file with every review you've ever received, all typed out and credited
</li><li>
	one text file with just the best short quotes from these reviews
</ol>
</li><li>
	<strong>Graphics, with a few different sizes of each:</strong>
<ol><li>
	artist photos  (studio shot, live shot, up close, far away)
</li><li>
	album cover graphic  (big version, small version)
</li><li>
	your logo, if you have one
</ol>
</li></ul>
	If you do this, just once, then the job of uploading your information to another website will be painless.
	You'll just say, “da-da-da! all done!” and let your MP3s upload while you go make dinner.
