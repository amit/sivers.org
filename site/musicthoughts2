Musicians, producers, artists, and engineers, <strong>check out the newest update of <a href="http://musicthoughts.com/">MusicThoughts</a></strong>.
</p><p>
Since I was 18, I'd always save <strong>inspiring quotes about making music</strong> from interviews with my heroes.
</p><p>
Any time I was feeling stuck on a new song, disappointed by my career, or lost perspective on a studio mixdown, I'd plop on the couch and read slowly through these favorite quotes.
</p><p>
Stuck on some lyrics, trying too hard to accurately express something, <a href="http://musicthoughts.com/t/27">this Brian Eno quote</a> let me be less specific, and more evocative.
</p><p>
Almost everything <a href="http://musicthoughts.com/author/1">John Cage said</a> would make me look at a dilemma in a new way.
</p><p>
Feeling I couldn't match up to a great start, <a href="http://musicthoughts.com/t/44">this Picasso quote</a> was a great reminder that feeling is universal.
</p><p>
When I was trying to finish my album, but just not satisfied, it was reassuring to know that <a href="http://musicthoughts.com/t/214">neither was John Lennon</a>, and his records turned out OK.
</p><p>
Then there's <a href="http://musicthoughts.com/t/342">this Kurt Vonnegut quote</a> which applies to so many things in life.
</p><p>
In 1999, I made <a href="http://musicthoughts.com/">MusicThoughts.com</a> as a place for everyone to share their inspiring quotes about making music, or to turn to in those moments when they're in need of new inspiration.
</p><p>
In 2008, I decided I wanted all of my future websites to be multi-lingual, so I thought MusicThoughts would be a great place to start.  I hired translators to translate all the quotes into Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Arabic, Japanese, and Chinese.  I also hired three different webdesigners to make it look better.  (Switch between different styles at <a href="http://musicthoughts.com/style">musicthoughts.com/style</a>.)
</p><p>
Now I've approved hundreds of new quotes submitted by others, paid the translators to translate them into all 10 languages, and updated the site again.
