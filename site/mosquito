	When you see a room full of people, make sure you are not thinking like a mosquito, looking at them as something to suck dry, to get what you want and move on.
</p><p>
	It's important to meet people, but more important to really get to know them.
	Ask questions.
	Listen.
	Make a point of <strong>discovering what you can do for them</strong>.
</p><p>
	The best opportunities will come from real friends, not “contacts”.
	Be a good friend.
	Relax.
	Don't be a mosquito.
