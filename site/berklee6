    <p><strong>6 things I wish I knew the day I started Berklee. Lessons apply to other aspects of life, too.</strong></p>

<p>
My old school - Berklee College of Music - asked me to speak to a packed auditorium of first-day students. I was thrilled. I had so much to say. I had thought about this a lot. I had been waiting 20 years to give this talk.
</p><p>
The 6 things:
</p><ol>
<li>Focus. Disconnect. Do not be distracted.</li>
<li>Do not accept their speed limit.</li>
<li>Nobody will teach you anything. You have to teach yourself.</li>
<li>Learn from your heroes, not only theirs.</li>
<li>Don't get stuck in the past.</li>
<li>When done, be valuable.</li>
</ol><p>
