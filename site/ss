The woman seemed to be making some pretty good points, until she stopped with, “Ugh! Those <em>(people she disagrees with)</em> are just so stupid!!”
</p><p>
She could have said Southerners, Northerners, Republicans, Democrats, Indians, or Americans. It doesn’t matter. She had just proven that she wasn’t being smart.
</p><p>
There are no smart people or stupid people, just people being smart or being stupid.
</p><p>
(And things are often not as they seem, so people who seem to be doing something smart or stupid, may not be. There’s always more information, more context, and <a href="/horses">more to the story</a>.)
</p><p>
<strong>Being smart means thinking things through</strong> - trying to find the real answer, not the first answer.
</p><p>
<strong>Being stupid means avoiding thinking by jumping to conclusions.</strong> Jumping to a conclusion is like quitting a game : you lose by default.
</p><p>
That’s why saying “I don’t know” is usually smart, because it’s refusing to jump to a conclusion.
</p><p>
So <strong>when someone says “They are so stupid!” - it means they’ve stopped thinking.</strong> They say it to feel finished with that subject, because there’s nothing they can do about that. It’s appealing and satisfying to jump to that conclusion.
</p><p>
So if you decide someone is stupid, it means you’re not thinking, which is not being smart.
</p><p>
Therefore: <strong>smart people don’t think others are stupid.</strong>
