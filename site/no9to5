<strong>I decided at 14 I was going to be a full-time musician.</strong>
</p><p>
Because of this, I knew:</p><ul>
<li>I'd never have a job</li>
<li>I'd never have a salary</li>
<li>I'd never have insurance</li>
<li>I'd never have a boss</li>
<li>I'd have no security - no guarantees</li>
<li>Nobody would help me - I'd have to bootstrap everything myself</li>
<li>Fighting against apathy and gatekeepers would be a constant struggle</li>
<li>I'd have to be one-in-a-million brilliant to achieve this incredibly difficult goal</li>
</ul><p>
But I was psyched about this!  This was my dream-come-true scenario.  I told everyone I was going to be a successful musician.
</p><p>
And I did. I worked nonstop. I started touring profitably when I was 18. Moved to New York City. Did whatever it takes to make a living as a musician.  When I was 27, I bought a house in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodstock,_New_York">Woodstock</a> with the money I made touring.  I was living the dream.
</p><p>
Today, the amazing <a href="http://rockstarlifelessons.com/">Carla Lynne Hall</a> asked me why I chose the entrepreneur path instead of the 9-5 job mindset.
</p><p>
<strong>But look at that list, up top, again.  It all applies to entrepreneurs, as well.</strong>
</p><p>
If you decide to start your own company, you're not going to have a job, boss, or guaranteed income. It'll be a constant uphill struggle, without help from anyone.
</p><p>
No wonder I fell into being an entrepreneur so naturally.
</p><p>
<strong>All those negatives are my dream-come-true scenario.</strong>
