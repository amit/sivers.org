There's a <a href="http://sivers.org/maslow">beautiful quote from Abraham Maslow</a>: “Life is an ongoing process of choosing between safety (out of fear and need for defense) and risk (for the sake of progress and growth). Make the growth choice a dozen times a day.”
</p><p>
You might have seen in <a href="http://sivers.org/bilbo">CD Baby's 10th birthday announcement last March</a> that I haven't worked at CD Baby since last year.  In fact I've hardly been there since 2002.  I designed all the internal systems to run without me, so that I could be free to go learn and invent new things.
</p><p>
But now my new projects are exciting me so much that I decided to hand over CD Baby to someone that's going to make it better than ever for you.  I chose <a href="http://www.discmakers.com/">Disc Makers</a> as the new owner because their president Tony Van Veen has been one of my favorite people for years, and I always felt they'd do a better job of running CD Baby than I would.
</p><p>
The CD Baby staff, location, name, and everything else will stay the same, but I think you'll start to notice more attention given to improvements that help you sell more music.
</p><p>
So, this isn't big news.  Just letting you know that CD Baby is in better hands now, and I'm off to new things.
