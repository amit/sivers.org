    <p id="booksummary">The full title - “Making Ideas Happen: Overcoming the Obstacles Between Vision and Reality” - describes its contents perfectly.  Great book on that subject.</p>
    <h2>my notes</h2>
    <p id="booknotes">
Many claim they create solely for themselves.  But this argument is selfish: an idea executed for an audience of one is an awful waste of potential inspiration and value for the greater good.<br>
<br>
Making ideas happen = (the idea) + organization and execution + forces of community + leadership capability<br>
<br>
Creativity x Organization = impact<br>
<br>
Someone who has loads of ideas but is so disorganized that no one particular idea is ever fully realized.  100 X 0 = 0.<br>
<br>
Someone with half the creativity and just a little more organizational ability would make a great deal more impact: 50 X 2 = 100<br>
<br>
The equation helps us understand why some “less-creative” artists might produce more work than their talented and inventive peers. A shocking and perhaps unfortunate realization emerges: someone with average creativity but stellar organizational skills will make a greater impact than the disorganized creative geniuses<br>
<br>
Thomas Kinkade and James Patterson employ many people to assist in the production and distribution of their work.<br>
<br>
Before authoring his first novel, Patterson was the CEO of J. Walter Thompson, one of the world’s top ad agencies. Climbing the ladder to CEO, he developed the strengths as a leader and organizer that have distinguished his performance as a writer. Regardless of what the critics say, Patterson makes ideas happen at an almost alarming rate.<br>
<br>
Brainstorming sessions often yield disappointing results. Ideas with great potential fade from the participants’ minds with each additional idea thrown into the mix. Strong possibilities are trumped by alternative - not necessarily better - possibilities.<br>
<br>
A surplus of ideas is as dangerous as a drought. The tendency to jump from idea to idea to idea spreads your energy horizontally rather than vertically.<br>
<br>
Approach every occasion of creativity with a dose of skepticism and a bias toward action.<br>
<br>
For each idea, you must capture and highlight your “Action Steps.”<br>
<br>
Each person needs to “own” their Action Steps.<br>
<br>
Taking and organizing extensive notes aren’t worth the effort.<br>
<br>
Everything is a project.<br>
<br>
Breaking each one down into its primary components: Action Steps, References, and Backburner Items.<br>
