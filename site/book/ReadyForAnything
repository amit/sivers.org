    <p id="booksummary">I read this in 2004, before Getting Things Done (same author), and liked it more, because it's more philosophical than instructional.  It made a big impact on me then.  I was just re-reading now for a little refresher.</p>
    <h2>my notes</h2>
    <p id="booknotes">
Maximum productivity is making something happen with as little effort as possible.<br>
<br>
Effort implies resistance.<br>
<br>
Improving productivity = dealing with the hindrances.<br>
<br>
Mosquitoes can ruin the hunt for big game.<br>
<br>
Something is coming - probably within a few days - that’s going to change your world.  Are you ready?  Or do you feel more out of control?<br>
<br>
Some major life event causes them to rethink it all and get some clarity around their commitments.  I suggest you do that weekly.<br>
<br>
If you try to make something too simple, it will make everything seem more complex and difficult.<br>
<br>
“How do I set priorities?” My question back: “What’s your job?”<br>
<br>
You must know what you want to maintain, accomplish, or experience.<br>
<br>
As you sensitize and train yourself to assess and dispatch anything appropriately, you increase your maturity to do that with ever loftier outcomes.<br>
