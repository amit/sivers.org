    <p id="booksummary">So many people love this book, but it just wasn't my style. Aiming to be funny and describing a crazy mindset, but I couldn't relate to either. Mostly about writing novels.</p>
    <h2>my notes</h2>
    <p id="booknotes">
Writing motivates you to look closely at life.<br>
<br>
Do it every day.  Do it as you would do scales on the piano. Do it by prearrangement with yourself. Do it as a debt of honor. And make a commitment to finishing things.<br>
<br>
Take people out of themselves and then back to themselves.<br>
<br>
Good writing is about telling the truth.<br>
<br>
Anyone who survived childhood has enough material to write for life.<br>
<br>
Sit down at approximately the same time every day. This is how you train your unconscious to kick in for you creatively.<br>
<br>
All I have to do is to write down as much as I can see through a one-inch picture frame.<br>
<br>
Writing a novel is like driving a car at night. You can see only as far as your headlights, but you can make the whole trip that way.<br>
<br>
A person’s faults are largely what make him or her likable.  They shouldn’t be too perfect; perfect means shallow and unreal and fatally uninteresting. I like for them to have a nice sick sense of humor.<br>
<br>
The writer is a person who is standing apart.<br>
<br>
“A writer is someone on whom nothing is lost.” - Henry James<br>
