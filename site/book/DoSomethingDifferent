    <p id="booksummary">I give the basic idea a 9-out-of-10 rating: that we shouldn't declare and hold to a personality type (“I'm an introvert! I'm adventurous!”), but rather should adapt to the situation. Halfway through the book I gave up because I got the idea and didn't like the writing style.</p>
    <h2>my notes</h2>
    <p id="booknotes">
Personalities fit into certain categories: agreeableness, conscientiousness, extroversion, neuroticism and openness to experience.<br>
<br>
Why people should become imprisoned by the category they were assigned to?<br>
<br>
Behave in the best and most appropriate way as required by the situation.<br>
<br>
Have a fluid and flexible personality that could flex according to need.<br>
<br>
The more fixed a person’s personality is, the harder they’ll find it to adapt to the new. The more vulnerable they will be to stress.<br>
<br>
Our past habits, which make up our personality, hijack our ability to exercise free will or act differently. They inhibit awareness.<br>
<br>
Having a definite personality has some advantages: We like to be seen to be consistent.  It becomes our personal trademark.  It is also highly energy-efficient.<br>
<br>
Our success in life will depend on the capacity to be different people.<br>
<br>
We use only a fraction of our potential personality.<br>
<br>
We have a toolkit full of useful behaviours, yet repeatedly pull out the same one.<br>
<br>
Solutions do not come from an analysis of the past.<br>
<br>
My parents’ preoccupation with the toils of daily living meant they left me to work out for myself how to shape a life.  I had to be totally self-led and self-sufficient. No one ever offered me advice or guidance, or said to me ‘do this’.  I certainly became the architect and designer of my own life.<br>
