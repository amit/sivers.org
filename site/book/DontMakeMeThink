    <h2>my notes</h2>
    <p id="booknotes">
Use conventions so people don't have to think for even a millisecond.<br>
<br>
Aim for self-evident first.<br>
If that fails, self-explanatory should be 2nd best.<br>
Try to not need to explain at all.<br>
<br>
Remember people quickly glance / scan a page, quickly looking for what they need.  They don't read all options.<br>
They guess fast instead of consider all.<br>
<br>
1. Create clear visual hierarchy<br>
2. Use conventions<br>
3. Page is in clearly defined areas<br>
4. Make obvious what's clickable<br>
5. Minimize noise<br>
<br>
Omit needless words.  Avoid happy-talk and instructions.<br>
<br>
Tabs must be real if you do them : where front-color is connected to content, and non-selected tabs are darkened with line beneath.<br>
<br>
Navigation is crucial but so is secondary and even third-ary!  Don't ignore importance of it.<br>
Breadcrumbs help, should be  Top > Sub > Sub-Sub > Here (in bold) <br>
But don't make breadcrums only navigation, and don't make last category double as page header.<br>
Show "you are here" clearly.<br>
Navigation helps show the context of your offerings.<br>
<br>
Logo everywhere links to home.<br>
<br>
The word they click should be the title of the destination page they hit!<br>
<br>
EVERY PAGE SHOULD ANSWER THESE IMMEDIATELY  (assume someone just woke up & saw any page in your site)<br>
- what site is this?<br>
- what page am I on?<br>
- what are the major site sections?<br>
- what are my options at this level?<br>
- where am I in the scheme of things?<br>
- how can I search?<br>
<br>
HOME PAGE NEEDS:<br>
- identify site & mission<br>
- answer: where do I start?<br>
- show heirarchy<br>
- search<br>
- teases (like magazine cover, enticing to see content inside)<br>
- timely content<br>
- deals<br>
- short cuts to most popular things<br>
- registration / sign-in / show if signed-in ("welcome back Dave!")<br>
- easy to find "what I'm lookign for"<br>
- but also "not looking for" : enticing things they didn't know about<br>
<br>
HOW TO GET THESE ACROSS:<br>
Tagline next to site ID (logo).  6-8 words.  Specific.  Meaningful and clear.<br>
Welcome blurb in top part.  1-2 sentences.  Important words bolded.<br>
Test it.<br>
<br>
TESTING TIPS:<br>
Just 3-4 people is plenty.  Pay $50/hr.  Camcorder pointing at screen.<br>
Ask them to think out loud.  Let them know they can do nothing wrong.<br>
When they say something generic, ask details.  If they say, "I like it", ask what they like, and same with negative.<br>
Hide site until time to start.  The second they see the home page, ask "What is this?  What would you click on?"<br>
Ignore "kayak" problems : the ones they turn around immediately.<br>
Resist adding things to solve problems.  That's rarely the answer.<br>
