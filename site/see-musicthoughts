Do you have some quotes that inspire you, as you make your own music?
</p><p>
I've always loved those little thoughts that would inspire me to dig deeper in my songwriting, try new sounds in the studio, or listen to music in a new way.
</p><p>
A few years ago, I collected these quotes into a simple website:
</p><p>
<a href="http://musicthoughts.com">http://musicthoughts.com</a>
</p><p>
It's there for two reasons:
</p><ol>
<li>inspire other musicians (you!)</li>
<li>collect other thoughts about music</li>
</ol><p>
I think you'll love this new update: I hired professional translators to translate MusicThoughts into nine languages: Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Arabic, Japanese, and Chinese.
</p><p>
Look again, and play with the language bar across the top:  <a href="http://musicthoughts.com">http://musicthoughts.com</a>
</p><p>
If you are fluent in any of these languages, please notice that below every translated quote is a link that says, "Can you improve this translation?"  Example, here: <a href="http://musicthoughts.com/t/546/pt">http://musicthoughts.com/t/546/pt</a>
</p><p>
If you can't see the Asian fonts, this link will tell you how to fix that: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2kzezd">http://tinyurl.com/2kzezd</a>.
</p><p>
After browsing around the site for a while, if you've got a favorite quote that inspires your music-making, please add it to the site.   I'm not trying to make this a big site of all thoughts about music - just a simple quiet place with a few of the most inspiring ones.
