<p>
Proudly say what you're NOT:  “If you like Celine Dion, you'll hate us.” ...and people who hate Celine Dion will love you, or at least give you a chance.
</p>
<p>
You can't please everyone in this world.  Recklessly exclude people.
</p>
<p>
Almost like you're the doorman at an exclusive club that plays only your music.  Maybe you wouldn't let in anyone wearing a suit.  Maybe you wouldn't let in anyone without a suit!
</p>
<p>
But <strong>know who you are, and have the confidence that somewhere out there, there's a little niche of people that would like your kind of music.</strong> They may only be 1% of the population.  But 1% of the world is 65 million people!
</p>
<p>
Loudly leave out 99% of the world.  When someone in your target 1% hears you excluding the part of the population they already feel alienated from, they'll be drawn to you.
</p>
<p>
Write down a list of artists who you don't like, and whose fans probably wouldn't like you.  Use that.
