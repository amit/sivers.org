	Your website can be your best tool, if you make it communicate with your fans and potential fans, TWO-WAY.
</p><p>
	Your website should get people involved, make them want to introduce themselves, ask questions, shout out.
</p><p>
	Your website should:
</p><ol><li>
	Get their email address!
	Interact!
	Make an easy fill-out form.
	(hint: try a fun question like “who are you?” or “do you know your own name?”)
</li><li>
	Encourage them to buy your CD, constantly.
	It's a great way to start a relationship.
</li><li>
	Show what's unique about you.
	Image, quirks, colors, moods.
</li><li>
	Make the sound clips easy to get to, not buried under layers
</li><li>
	Answer the obvious questions: who are you, what do you look like, let me hear the music
</li><li>
	Acknowledge them!
	Have their pictures on your site.
	Answer their questions on your site.
	Show them they ARE a part of your life.
</li></ol><p>
	And make sure you have your own domain name.
