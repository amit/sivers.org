Something's changed.  <strong>I just can't get myself to buy an iPhone</strong>.
</p><p>
I had been planning it for months, when friends would tell me about theirs, I knew I was going to wait for the 3G version. It's even the reason I chose AT&amp;T. The day it was announced I thought, “Yes! Finally! July 9! Can't wait!”
</p><p>
But luckily I had time to think, between announcement-date and availability-date.  And as time went on, I wanted it less and less.  I realized <strong>my existing phone works just fine</strong>.
</p><p>
Maybe it was the amazing <a href="http://storyofstuff.com/">Story of Stuff video</a> that made me realize that <strong>every manufactured thing creates a ton of waste</strong> just to make.
</p><p>
Maybe it's the <strong>savings</strong>: <a href="http://www.geekculture.com/joyoftech/joyarchives/1125.html">(click this comic:)<br /><img src="/images/iphonecomic.gif" /></a>
</p><p>
Mostly it's that I've been <a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2007/07/11/how-to-travel-the-world-with-10-pounds-or-less-plus-how-to-negotiate-convertibles-and-luxury-treehouses/">living out of a backpack</a> for much of the year.
</p><p>
<strong>Every item is now judged harshly as a major burden that better have a damn good explanation why</strong> I should carry it around with me everywhere as I travel.
</p><p>
After my <a href="http://sivers.org/asia-diary">amazing time riding a motorcycle around Vietnam</a>, you might think I'd want to buy a motorcycle, but no - then I'd have to OWN it. (Say the word “own” with your most disgusted po-faced tone.)
</p><p>
<strong>Wouldn't it be more fun to never have to OWN anything, but to just have it when you need it?</strong>
</p><p>
P.S.  Here's my <a href="http://www.bikingviking.is/?id=64">next daydream bike ride</a>.
