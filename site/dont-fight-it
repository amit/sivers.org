Knowing I read a lot, someone recently asked how I balance learning and working.
</p><p>
When do you stop reading and get back to work?
</p><p>
When do you stop working and go learn something new?
</p><p>
Being self-employed and in control of my own schedule, I used to wrestle with this a lot.
</p><p>
I'd be so thirsty to keep reading and learning, that I'd feel bad I hadn't done any real work in weeks.
</p><p>
Other times I'd just work, work, work for weeks without stopping to read some of the brilliant books I'd already bought.
</p><p>
Then I realized something so obvious it's funny that I'm writing it here:
</p><p>
<strong>Stop wrestling. Don't fight it. Go with it, either direction.</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>If you're excited to work, <a href="/scares-excites-do-it">work</a></strong>.  Sneak out of bed at 4am if your toes are tapping, and go do what's on your mind.
</p><p>
But <strong>if you're tired, <a href="http://arvindn.livejournal.com/57651.html">don't fight it</a>.  Sleep</strong>.
</p><p>
If you've got <strong>writer's block, <a href="/book/IgnoreEverybody">enjoy the silence while it lasts</a></strong>. In another day, week, or month, you'll be so filled with things to say you'll be sneaking out of bed again.
</p><p>
Who knows why the brain is into different things at different times.
</p><p>
But <strong>we're so much more effective when we follow what our body wants to do, rather than trying to fight it</strong>.
</p><p>
(<em>Of course I'm writing this as a reminder to myself, because today was one of those days where I wanted to get a bunch of programming done, but I was at this computer for hours and didn't get a damn thing done.  All I wanted to do was read on the couch.  So I shut the laptop and read for a few hours.  Which was just what I needed, and ended up inspiring the hell out of me, so that afterwards I jumped up and came back to programming with gusto. Now effectively.</em>)
