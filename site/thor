Last week we had dinner at a quiet restaurant on the Oregon coast, and sat near two people that were obviously on a first date. (“So, do you have any siblings?”)
</p><p>
When their conversation took an interesting turn, we couldn't help but listen:
</p><p>
“You're an atheist? How can you not believe in God?”
</p><p>
&nbsp; “How can you not believe in Zeus or Thor?”
</p><p>
“That's stupid. Those are old folk-tales.”
</p><p>
&nbsp; “They were God! You're dismissing others' beliefs, calling them folk-tales? So you're also an atheist for most gods that have ever existed. I just go one further.”
</p><p>
“I'm not an atheist!”
</p><p>
&nbsp; “You and I are almost identical in our beliefs! If history has named, say, 520 gods, you don't believe in 519 of them, I don't believe in 520 of them.”
</p><p>
&nbsp; ...(long pause)...
</p><p>
“What do you do on Christmas or Easter, then? Do you feel weird as a non-believer?”
</p><p>
&nbsp; “What do you do on Thursday?”
</p><p>
“Huh?”
</p><p>
&nbsp; “Thursday was named after Thor. It's Thor's day. Do you feel weird as a non-believer?”
</p><p>
“That's not fair.”
</p><p>
&nbsp; “All the English days of the week are named after gods, sun, and moon. Look it up on Wikipedia. It's wild.”
</p><p>
“Why are you so into this?”
</p><p>
&nbsp; “I'm not. Spent maybe 20 minutes on it, tops. I'm not on a mission to dis-prove God any more than you're on a mission to dis-prove Zeus. It's really no big deal to me.”
</p><p>
“So, I guess we're not compatible, huh?”
</p><p>
&nbsp; “Of course we are! I like you a lot. And we do agree on 519 of the gods, so we'll just not mention that last one.”
</p><p>
“OK. Deal. I like you a lot, too.”
</p><p>
&nbsp; ...(long pause)...
</p><p>
&nbsp; “So what's your favorite band?”
</p><p>
“Oh, God.”
</p>
<hr />
<p>
I always love an <a href="/jaddr">opposite point of view</a>.  Then I liked the reframing of the situation from “we're opposite” to “we agree on 519 of the 520 gods.”
</p><p>
We went home and looked up the etymology of the English days of the week, and found:
</p><ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thursday">Thursday</a>: named for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor">Thor</a>, who gets his own <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0800369/">blockbuster movie</a> next year</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday">Friday</a>: named for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frijj%C5%8D">Frige</a>, the love goddess</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday">Saturday</a>: named for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_%28mythology%29">Saturn</a>, Roman god of agriculture</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunday">Sunday</a>: the sun's day</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monday">Monday</a>: the moon's day</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuesday">Tuesday</a>: named for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%BDr">Tiw</a>, the god of single combat, later equated with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_%28mythology%29">Mars</a>, the Roman god of war</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wednesday">Wednesday</a>: named for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%C5%8Dden">Woden</a> aka <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odin">Odin</a>, head god of almost everything, maybe a precursor to Father Christmas or Santa Claus, and will be played by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000164/">Anthony Hopkins</a> in Thor's movie, bringing it all back around</li>
</ul>
<p>
I love that we're living in a time where <strong>it's so easy to learn</strong>.
</p><p>
Like the date asked, “Why are you so into this?” - When I was a kid, you had to be “so into” something to go to the trouble of going to the library to find books on a subject, or going back to the card catalog to find related books.
</p><p>
It used to be that if you overheard someone say something, you'd just remember and repeat it, without looking it up for yourself, because it wasn't worth the trouble.
</p><p>
Now you can start to dive into any subject with some whimsical web browsing - an alternate to watching a TV show.  And because I invested so little time into it, I'm emotionally less invested into <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=subscribe">subscribing</a> to it (“signing my name to it”) - and can see it as just an alternate point of view.
