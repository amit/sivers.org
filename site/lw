<p>
Most of the time I feel smart, successful, and driven - like I’ve got it all figured out.
</p><p>
But last month a bunch of stuff knocked me on my ass.  I’ve never felt so wrong.
</p><p>
I vulnerably called on friends for help.
</p><ul>
<li><a href="http://www.homesweetpdx.com/our-story/">Amber</a> reminded me to pull my head out of today, and think <a href="http://sivers.org/time">long-term</a> again.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Marx">Jeff</a> told me to get my swagger back and relish the moment.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariel_Hyatt">Ariel</a> said I should really accept and feel this pain, instead of moving on so fast like I always do.</li>
</ul><p>
Each different perspective made me feel good for a while, then I’d fall back into the whirlpool of destructive thoughts.
</p><p>
Whenever something’s wrong in my life, I’ve asked myself this amazing question:
</p><p>
<strong>“What’s great about this?”</strong>
</p><p>
But now my only answer was, “Nothing. This just sucks.”  I tried asking it again every day or two, but the answer was the same.  Down the whirlpool I went.
</p><p>
After moping at the bottom of the ocean for a few weeks, I got a bright memory from my former self.
</p><p>
<strong>I actually love being wrong</strong>, even though it cracks my confidence, <strong>because that’s the only time I learn.</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>I actually love being lost</strong>, even though it fuels fears, <strong>because that’s when I go somewhere unexpected.</strong>
</p><p>
<a href="http://sivers.org/book">I pursue these things</a> in small digestable doses.  I love little lessons that surprise my expectations and <a href="http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/the-fireplace-delusion">change my mind</a>.  &nbsp; <em>(This is why I aim to make <a href="http://www.ted.com/speakers/derek_sivers#talks">my TED talks</a> surprising. If we’re not surprised, we’re not learning.)</em>
</p><p>
But I finally answered “What’s great about this?”:
</p><p>
Getting knocked on my ass made me humble as hell.  It’s been years since I’d called for help.  It’s been years since my <a href="http://thebuddhistblog.blogspot.com/2007/08/zen-story-cup-of-tea.html">cup was so empty</a>.  It’s been years since I was so open to advice. 
</p><p>
I smiled, thinking of how much I’ve learned from my friends these past few weeks.  I realized how ultimately happy it makes me to be so empty, even if it really hurts at first.  <strong>It’s better than thinking I’ve got it all figured out.</strong>
</p><p>
And with that, the sun came up and the whirlpool went away.
</p><p>
Thank you life.  Thank you friends.
