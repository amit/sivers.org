<p>If you own or run a company, and haven't read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wikinomics-Mass-Collaboration-Changes-Everything/dp/1591841380/cdbaby">Wikinomics</a> yet, you really should.</p>

<p>It gives some amazing examples of how companies in many different industries from gold mines to pharmaceuticals are learning that if you give anyone-interested full access to the data, they collectively can do much better work than any in-house staff.</p>

<p>Seth Godin pointed at a new example of <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2007/09/finding-the-lon.html">how this is working picking winning stocks</a>.</p>

<p>Of course I've been thinking about the different ways this could apply to CD Baby.</p>

<p>I started with a tiny move, letting anyone <a href="http://cdbaby.com/skin">skin the cdbaby.com website</a>.</p>

<p>Any ideas for other places the world, collectively, would do a bunch better job than a few people, in-house?</p>
