Like everyone, I can get deeply curious about something, and dive in.
</p><p>
Starting five years ago, I got deeply curious about the differences between countries and cultures, fascinated with understanding the different perspectives. I talked about a few fun ones in <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/derek_sivers_weird_or_just_different.html">this 2-minute TED talk</a>.
</p><p>
So two years ago, <a href="http://sivers.org/singapore">I moved to Singapore</a>, and started visiting all the countries in Asia, asking dumb questions, making good friends.
</p><p>
Getting to know these countries is endlessly interesting.  I want to understand them as well as I understand the 50 U.S. states.
</p><p>
But my learning felt too unstructured.  So while walking around Yogyakarta, Indonesia, remembering “<strong>the best way to learn something is to teach it</strong>”, I came up with an ambitious plan.
</p><p>
I decided to produce and publish <strong>16 books per year on 16 countries in Asia</strong>: Cambodia, China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam. 
</p><p>
Sure, they wouldn’t be great at first, but I committed to <strong>improving them every year for many years</strong>.  After a few years of doing this, they should be pretty awesome.
</p><p>
Instead of being all-encompassing, I decided to focus just on entrepreneurship: a network I was already tapped into, a good filter for understanding a country’s culture, and a subject that may be useful to others.
</p><p>
What to name it?  That only took a minute.  I like <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2003/06/naming_a_busine.html">Seth Godin’s advice about naming</a>.  The <strong>E</strong>ntrepreneur’s <strong>G</strong>uide?  E… G…  Egg!  Golden Egg?  Too cliché.  <strong>Wood Egg?</strong>  Yep!  Sounds like an exotic carved Thai or Indonesian treasure.  Good enough.
</p><p>
I set up a Singapore corporation for it from my Yogyakarta hotel room that night in August 2011, and began the next day.
</p><p>
And now, <strong>after a year and a half of work</strong> - (and some hard lessons learned that I’ll write about soon) - <strong>they’re done!  So my new company is launched:</strong>
