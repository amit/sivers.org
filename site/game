You might have heard this one before.  If not, pay attention.  It’s a good one.
</p><p>
Imagine I announce <strong>I am going to sell a $100 bill by auction, and the bidding starts at only $1.</strong>
</p><p>
The only rule of the game is this: <strong>if you are the 2nd-highest bidder, you still have to pay what you bid</strong>, but you don’t get the $100 bill. 
</p><p>
Of course I get some bids for $1, $2, $3.  Why not?  Hey - a chance to get $100 for $3!
</p><p>
The bids keep coming in.  By $51 I’m happy - I’m going to profit now.
</p><p>
Once they get to $90, there’s less enthusiasm, but reason to stay in.
</p><p>
Once they get to $99, though, the person offering $98 thinks, “Uh oh. The other person isn’t backing down,” and raises their bid to $100 so as not to be 2nd-lowest and lose the entire $98.
</p><p>
But now the person offering $99 raises their bid to $101.  Better to lose only $1 than $99, right?
</p><p>
Soon they’re offering $110, $120, $150.  This game could go on forever.
</p><p>
<strong>The real problem: not thinking it through in advance.</strong>
</p><p>
When the game starts, it’s easy to think short-term and say, “Ooh! Good deal!”
</p><p>
Then when it’s too late, you slowly realize, ”Uh-oh. What have I done?”
</p><p>
<strong>A lot of people get into life situations like this.</strong>
</p><p>
The entrepreneur who borrows a lot of money to test an idea.
</p><p>
The homeowner who bought a house at the top end of their budget.
</p><p>
The romantic who gets into a relationship with someone who is already in a relationship.
</p><p>
You can hear them whining about how they’re so in debt, or their sweetheart is cheating.
</p><p>
Oops!  Didn’t think that one through, huh?
</p><p>
The game was clearly rigged against them, so the smart choice is to not play that game at all.
We should always ask, “How will this game end?”
</p><p>
<strong>It’s <em>hard</em> to think through the long-term implications of everything we’re doing now.</strong>
</p><p>
It’s hard, but it’s worth the effort.  I’m just posting this here as a reminder (to myself, too).
