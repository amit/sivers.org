<p>
Get to the point of being a novice marketer/promoter/agent.  Then hand it to an expert.
</p>
<p>
Moby, the famous techno artist, says the main reason for his success was that he found experts to do what they're best at, instead of trying to do it himself.
</p>
<p>
(Paraphrased:) “Instead of trying to be a booking agent, publicist, label, and manager, I put my initial energy into finding and impressing the best agent, publicist, label, and manager.  And I just kept making lots of the best music I could.”
</p>
<p>
If you sense you are becoming an expert, figure out what your real passions in life are and act accordingly.
</p>
<p>
Maybe you're a better publicist than bassist.  Maybe you're a better bassist than publicist.
</p>
<p>
Maybe it's time to admit your weakness as a booking agent, and hand it off to someone else.  Maybe it's time to admit your genius as a booking agent, and commit to it full-time.
