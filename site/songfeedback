<h3>What do you do for feedback on a new song you're writing?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Do you play it for a few friends, looking for <strong>praise</strong>?</li>
<li>Do you play it for a few friends, looking for <strong>criticism</strong>? (Really asking, “What don't you like about it?”)</li>
<li>Do you upload it to your site, and <strong>email everyone you know</strong>, asking what they think?</li>
<li>Do you send it to a company for <strong>paid critique</strong>?</li>
<li>Do you have a songwriting <strong>teacher or mentor</strong>?</li>
</ul>

<p>When you get feedback, <strong>are you looking to change and improve your song?</strong></p>
<p>Or by the time someone hears it, is it pretty much done?</p>

<p>
When I was at Berklee College of Music, then later living in New York City, I loved the <strong>songwriting workshops where you'd play unfinished songs for one teacher/mentor and a room full of other songwriters.  They'd really tear it apart, analyze every note and word, and suggest improvements</strong>.
</p><p>
I learned so much about songwriting from those sessions.  Not just for my own songs, but it's really educational to help improve other people's songs, too.
</p><p>
But that was before the internet. <strong>Is there something like that online, now?</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>What do you do for feedback on a new song you're writing?</strong>  The more info you can give, the better.  I'm really trying to understand other people's approaches to this.  Thanks!
