A person asks you, “What kind of music do you do?”<br />
Musicians say, “All styles. Everything.”
</p>
<p>
That person then asks, “So who do you sound like?”<br />
Musicians say, “Nobody. We're totally unique. Like nothing you've ever heard before.”
</p>
<p>
What does that person do?<br />
Nothing.<br />
They might make a vague promise to check you out sometime.<br />
Then they walk on, and forget about you! <br />
Why???<br />
<strong>You didn't arouse their curiosity! You violated a HUGE rule of self-promotion! Bad bad bad!</strong>
</p>
<p>
What if you had said, “It's 70's porno-funk music being played by men from Mars.”<br />
Or... “This CD is a delicate little kiss on your earlobe from a pink-winged pixie.”<br />
Or... “It's deep-dancing reggae that magically places palm trees and sand wherever it is played, and grooves so deep it makes all non-dancers get drunk on imaginary island air, and dance in the sand.”
</p>
<p>
Any one of these, and you've got their interest.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Get yourself a magic key phrase that describes what you sound like.</strong>  Try out a few different ones, until you see which one always gets the best reaction from strangers.  Use it.  Have it ready at a moment's notice.
</p>
<p>
It doesn't have to narrow what you do at all.  Any of those three examples I use above could sound like anything.
</p>
<p>
And that's just the point - <strong>if you have a magic phrase that describes your music in curious but vague terms, you can make total strangers start wondering about you.</strong>
</p>
<p>
But whatever you do, stay away from the words “everything”, “nothing”, “all styles”,  and “totally unique”.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Say something!</strong>
