A friend tonight said, “I couldn't be an entrepreneur. I need safety. I need the certainty of a steady paycheck, without having to worry if my business is going to fail.”
</p><p>
I haven't had a job since 1992, so I had forgotten that mindset, and was honestly surprised. I realized we now have opposite associations for safety.

I said, “I couldn't have a job. I need safety. I need the certainty of my own company, where I'm in total control of my income, without having to worry if a boss will fire me.”
