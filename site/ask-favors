	Don’t be afraid to ask for favors.
</p>
<p>
	Some people like doing favors!
</p>
<p>
	It’s like asking for directions in a city.
	People get an ego boost when they know the answer to something you’re asking.
	They’ll gladly answer to show off their knowledge.
</p>
<p>
	When I lived in New York City, one bold musician I know called me and said, “I’m coming to New York in 2 months. Can you give me a list of all the important contacts you think I should meet?”
	What guts!
	But I laughed, and did a search in my database, emailing him a list of 40 people he should call, and mention my name.
</p>
<p>
	Sometimes you need to find something specific: a video director, a sound system you can borrow, a free rehearsal studio.
	Call up everyone you know and ask!
	This network of friends you are creating will know how to get everything you want in life.
</p>
<p>
	Some people (perhaps on your mailing list) have time on their hands and would rather help you do something useful, instead of sitting at home in front of the TV another night.
	Need help doing promotion?
	Need help getting equipment to a show?
	Just ask them!
