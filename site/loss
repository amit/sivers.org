<strong>In one year:</strong> (2007)
</p><ul>
<li>My wife divorced me, and took my life savings.</li>
<li>90% of my company was no longer mine, on a <a href="http://sivers.org/mistake">technicality</a>.</li>
<li>My apartment was destroyed, so I slept and showered in the warehouse.</li>
<li>All my employees, led by my good friend and VP, led a mutiny against me. (I never returned, and never saw them again.)</li>
<li>I invested everything I had left in a very conservative fund, which fell 50% immediately, and never came back.</li>
<li>I invested everything I had left in a different conservative fund, which also fell 50%, and never came back.</li>
<li>The woman I was madly in love with married the guy she would always complain to me about.</li>
</ul><p>
Two weeks after that year ended, three companies called asking if I wanted to sell my company.  Though I had said no to that question for ten years, this time I said <a href="http://sivers.org/done">yes</a>.
</p><p>
I had messed up so bad, I had to walk away.  I had done everything wrong, and needed to cleanse myself of all those bad decisions.  I needed to take some time to learn from my mistakes, and replace my thoughts with new ones.  A self-made back-to-schooling.
</p><p>
I look back at that year, and know it won't get much worse.  If I can handle that, I can handle anything.
</p><p>
The company sale was announced.  The first time someone said “congratulations” I said, “For what? I messed up so bad I lost my baby. That's nothing to congratulate.”   (For future congratulations, I just <a href="http://sivers.org/horses">shrug</a>.)
</p><p>
We all <strong>underestimate our ability to massively change our life</strong> when it's gone off track.
</p><p>
Say “no” where you used to say “yes”.  Say “yes” where you used to say “no”.  Do the thing that scares you the most, then get up and go.
</p><p>
<strong>For those of you considering a massive change, I can tell you from experience:</strong>
</p><p>
It's awesome here on the other side.
