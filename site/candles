<em>(Someone asked me how they could sell more of their instrumental music. My answer:)</em>
</p><p>
For instrumental music, it sells best if you <strong>tie it into a purpose</strong>.
</p><p>
Massage music sells very well. <br />
Yoga music sells very well. <br />
Instrumental Christmas music sells very well. 
... all because they're selling <strong>more than just harmony, melody, arrangements</strong> : they're selling something that non-music people find useful. <strong>They solve a problem</strong>.
</p><p>
Different example: 
</p><p>
<strong>Imagine two candlemakers.</strong>
</p><p>
One says, “<strong>My candles have only the finest wax with the best quality wick!</strong>”
</p><p>
The other says, “<strong>These are prayer candles. Light one whenever you pray.</strong>”
</p><p>
There are dozens of people who will buy the first. 
</p><p>
But there are <strong>millions</strong> who will buy the second.
