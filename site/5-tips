A guy writing a book asked me for 5 tips for musicians, today.  Here are the 5 I gave off the top of my head:
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Turn off your computer</strong>.  Improve that unfinished song, without distractions.  We're drowning in a world of mouse-clickers.  <strong>Stand apart from the pack by doing the focused work of improving your skills</strong>.  The key that unlocks the door to success is not online, it's in you.
</li><li>
<strong>Whatever excites you, go do it</strong>.  Whatever scares you, go do it.  <strong>Whatever drains you or bores you, stop doing it immediately!</strong>  Find someone else who loves it, instead.
</li><li>
<strong>Meet 3 new people each week who might help you</strong>.  “Do It Yourself” doesn't mean do it ALL yourself.  You need help.  There are people who love booking gigs, love promoting, love building websites.  Put a few hours a week into finding them.  <strong>Let them help you</strong>.  Email strangers, and suggest a phone call or lunch.  Almost everyone says yes.  
</li><li>
<strong>Keep in touch</strong> with people.  The best connections always happen right after a recent contact.  It's always the person you talked to yesterday who will get you a gig or introduce you to a key contact, because you're at the forefront of their mind.  Just <strong>put aside 30 minutes every few days</strong> to call people who matter to you, and say hello.  Send them something you think they'd like, whether a link, an article, a trinket, or a pizza.  
</li><li>
Bring out your weird side.  What's great about the long tail is that there can be infinite niches.  Be (and trumpet yourself as) <strong>the best at your tiny sharply-defined niche</strong>.  Better to be the world's leading songwriter of songs about seaweed, than yet-another normal-but-good rock band or folksinger.
</li></ol>
